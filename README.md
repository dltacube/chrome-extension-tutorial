# chrome-extension-tutorial
This is a fixed version of google chrome's extension tutorial. I wrote some brief notes
[here](https://heyoni.github.io/2017/09/05/chrome-extension-tutorial.html)

This won't work straight out of the box. You'll need to fill out lines 61 and 62 on the `popup.js`
with your own API key.
